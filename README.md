# CulturLens Machine Learning
CulturLens is a mobile application that utilizes machine learning to detect sacred objects in Bali through the smartphone camera. The app will provide relevant information and restrictions about these objects, enhancing the cultural awareness of users. Additionally, it will feature a community forum for tourists to engage in discussions about Balinese culture and traditions. It is hoped that this application can reduce tourists who violate the traditional values ​​of sacred objects in Bali.

## Description
This repository contains machine learning projects used in the CulturLens mobile application (Android). It includes datasets, methods, tools, libraries, and IDEs used in the machine learning implementation of the CulturLens mobile application.

## Method
In building the machine learning model for the CulturLens application, we will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in various computer vision tasks, including medical image analysis.

## Tools/IDE/Library
- TensorFlow
- Google Colaboraty
- Numpy
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- os
## Datasets
We got a collection of data from the object location directly, we collected more than 1400 photos with many labels, namely 7 sacred object labels
